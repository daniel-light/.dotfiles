# todo: you need to build the command-t extension it has to be built against the
# same version of ruby as vim. See the README


#####
# Update instructions
# git submodule foreach "git checkout master && git pull"
# command-t:
#   switch to the vim-linked ruby (run :ruby puts "#{RUBY_VERSION}-p#{RUBY_PATCHLEVEL}")
#   cd to command-t/ruby/command-t
#   ruby extconf.rb
#   make
# vim-go:
#   definitely requires some set up. Not sure about updating. :GoInstall maybe does it?
